## Introduction

>I’m Alfie, a Computer Science (AI) student at The University of Plymouth. My journey has been "incredible" (as noted by Dr Jeffes): in June 2021, at age 18, I suffered a severe brain injury ([subdural haematoma and diffuse axonal injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) leaving me in a coma for one month and hospitalised for six months...

>However, I came out of hospital determined to not let the brain injury defeat me thus I started a Foundation Year in Computer Science at Plymouth University in September 2022. I am going into my third year, aiming for a first-class honours degree, with a particular interest in mathematical modules, Software Engineering, and AI.

>Despite the catastrophic setback, I’ve defied all odds:

| Year      | Milestone                                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **2021**  | Traumatic brain injury (age 18)                 |
| **2022**  | Left hospital; immediately started Foundation Year |
| **2023**  | Year 1: Achieved a 2:2 but got the second-highest grade out of **166 hand ins** in a mathematical coursework to make an AVL Binary Search Tree (81.6%) |
| **2024**  | Completed Year 2 with a strong 2:1 average and 78% in an Android App for the Software Engineering 2 module |
| **2025**  | Entering Year 3 aiming for a first-class honours |

### 🎯 Current Goals
- Achieve **80%+** in all final-year coursework
- Complete and launch my innovative AI app, **VidBriefs 2.0**
- Graduate with a **First-class degree** by 2026

### 🛠️ Skills & Experience

AI Products:

- VidBriefs: An iOS app for video summarisation, built with Swift and Python(Django)
- Dr. Fit: A health and fitness assistant website using HTML, JavaScript and Python(Flask)

University modules I excelled in:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/1001-cw" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">COMP1001 Computer Systems report: Exploring AVX intrinsics and image processing with C++</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/1003-cw" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">COMP1003 Algorithms and Data Structures report: Implementing an AVL Binary Search Tree in C#</a></li>

</ul>

I’m genuinely passionate about AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Mathematics. I am also interested in Business, particularly Marketing, Entrepreneurship, and Product Development, with the goal of innovating in AI products and services to improve quality-of-life in the coming years.
