As an enthusiast of mathematics, I explore various mathematical concepts that captivate me. My studies at the University of Plymouth, where I am pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, often intertwine with my mathematical interests. Recently, I've been creating an efficient <a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/1003-CW/tree/main/Report/AVL" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88">C# AVL tree, for my university coursework, which anyone can run with .NET SDK, to quickly and easily see a tree structured with box-drawing characters and necessary indentation, by quickly running ./AVL-run.sh in the terminal. This project showcases a very mathmatical complex search algorithm. Printing visually depth-first from the top-down of the root node, like so:

## Tools and Software I Use

- **MATLAB**: A staple in my computational mathematics toolkit.
- **Python (NumPy, SciPy)**: Essential for data analysis and scientific computing.

## My Mathematical Achievements

I highlight my recognitions and awards in mathematics, which reflect my dedication and skill in the field:

2022 - Received 83% in my foundation year mathematics module: 97.92% in the coursework, and 62.86% in the exam.

2024 - In my first-year mathematics module, in my second semester, after prolonged recovery from my injury, I achieved {…} in the module, 80.67% in the exam, and {…} in the coding report.
