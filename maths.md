As a fervent enthusiast of mathematics, I explore various mathematical concepts that captivate me. My studies at the University of Plymouth, where I am pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, often intertwine with my mathematical interests.

## Maths for Machine Learning

## Applied Mathematics

This section showcases examples of applying mathematical principles in real-world scenarios. Whether it's through programming projects, statistical analysis, or model simulations, the application of theory to practice is vividly depicted.

## Tools and Software I Use

- **MATLAB**: A staple in my computational mathematics toolkit.
- **Python (NumPy, SciPy)**: Essential for data analysis and scientific computing.

## My Mathematical Achievements

I highlight my recognitions and awards in mathematics, which reflect my dedication and skill in the field:

2022 - Received 83% in my foundation-year mathematics module: 97.92% in the coursework, and 62.86% in the exam.

2024 - In my first-year mathematics module, in my second semester, after further recovery from my injury: I achieved {...} in the module, 80.67% in the exam, and {...} in the coding report.
