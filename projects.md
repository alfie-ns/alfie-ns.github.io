# Personal AI Projects

## DrFit

<a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/drfit-api"target="_blank" style="color: #448c88">DrFit</a> is a comprehensive web application I developed for my COMP1004 project at the University of Plymouth. It serves as an AI-powered personal trainer, helping users track their fitness progress and create customized workout plans.

### Key Features:

- User registration with detailed fitness data collection
- Personalized fitness plan generation
- Secure password management with regex validation
- Unit conversion for height and weight
- SQLite database integration
- JSON file integration for data management
- Email confirmation system using Flask-Mail

### Technologies Used:

- Backend: Python Flask with Blueprints
- Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Database: SQLite

### Future Plans:

- [ ] Implement machine learning for more accurate fitness recommendations
- [ ] Add social features for user interaction and motivation

- [  ] Integrate with wearable fitness devices for real-time data tracking

## VidBriefs IOS App

VidBriefs is an iOS app I created to generate concise video summaries, currently focusing on YouTube content. It allows users to quickly grasp the essence of long-form videos without watching them in full.

### Current Features:

- YouTube video summarization
- Custom prompt selection for targeted summaries

### Planned Improvements:

- [ ] Expand compatibility to additional platforms (e.g., TedTalks, Movies)
- [ ] Implement diverse AI prompting methods
- [ ] Develop a learning algorithm to enhance AI summarization based on user viewing patterns
- [ ] Transform the app into a 'ChatGPT for video summaries'

### Project Structure:

The project is divided into three GitHub repositories:

1. [VidBriefs App](https://github.com/alfie-ns/vidbriefs-app): iOS application
2. [VidBriefs API](https://github.com/alfie-ns/vidbriefs-api): Backend API
3. [VidBriefs Desktop](https://github.com/alfie-ns/VidBriefs-Desktop): Python script for quick video insights

### VidBriefs Desktop:

A Python script for rapid video insight extraction:

- Uses YouTube API for transcript retrieval
- Employs GPT-4 API for video summarization
- Utilizes OpenAI API for answering user queries about the video
