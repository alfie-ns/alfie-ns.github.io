title: "My life"
---

I was born in February 2003 and had a normal childhood and education. I developed an early interest in computers, setting up a fully functional Minecraft server at the age of 10 on an early-stage MacBook. I was also fascinated by my dad's work as a Solution Architect, and I found the concept of coding quite appealing. Fast forward to 2021: while on our way to a pub to watch the World Cup, my friend dramatically crashed into a tree. I was airlifted to St George's Hospital after sustaining a severe brain injury and narrowly survived a coma that lasted 3.5 weeks. Subsequently, I was moved to Epsom Hospital, where I spent six months.
Indeed, the brain injury profoundly affected my life but also instilled in me a strong determination. Consequently, between a year and a half to a year later, I enrolled at university and moved into university halls, beginning a foundation year to gradually acclimate to university life following my injury.<br><br>
I excelled during my foundation year, achieving <em><a href="https://alfie-ns.github.io/math054.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88">83.90% in MATH054</a></em>, thanks to discovering and being mentored by a PhD Maths student, Henry Thomas. I began my degree in <a href="https://alfie-ns.github.io/BSc_Computer_Science.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88">Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)</a> in 2023. AI has been pivotal in my recovery and a life-saver,  quickly reinstating my independence post-injury through summarising and personalised one-to-one teaching. I utilise AI in every possible way, from my phone to my computers, where I manually adjust the titles of my chats with checkboxes ([ ]) to systematically traverse them, thereby ensuring a comprehensive understanding and mastery of the chat's content.

Paradoxically, despite the challenges posed by my ongoing recovery, I also performed well in my first year, particulary in <a href="https://alfie-ns.github.io/comp1003.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">COMP1003(Algorithms, Data Structures and Mathematics)</a> achieving 80% in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1003-test" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">maths test</a> and <em><a href="https://alfie-ns.github.io/COMP1003-Report-Marks--24.xlsx" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">81.6% in my report</em>, where I studied and implemented a complex <a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/1003-CW" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">C# AVL tree.</a> Additionally, I secured <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1001-cw" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">71% in the COMP1001 (Computer Systems) report</a>, a very difficult, conceptually fundamental low-level computing module, where I worked diligently to understand the intricacies of C/C++ and using Linux to make a <a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/1001-CW/blob/main/q3/q3/q3a.sh" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">bash script for Q3A</a>. In <a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/1001-CW/tree/main/q1/CW-2" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">Q1</a>, I was tasked with vectorising routines using advanced x86-64 SSE/SSE2/SSE4/AVX/AVX2 intrinsics. In <a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/1001-CW/blob/main/q3/q3/q3b.cpp" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">Q3B</a>, I modified a program to process image files efficiently using directory iteration. I am now preparing to work relentlessly hard in year 2, while eagerly anticipating my third-year modules, where I'll be studying <em>Machine Learning, Full-stack Development, Human-Robot Interaction, and Big Data Analytics.</em>,

<b>According to leading doctors, I am expected to continue recovering throughout the decade and will improve in all areas. I will focus on learning my 2nd and 3rd years of study, while slowly crafting and developing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/vidbriefs/id6471598372" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">innovative AI products</a> in the coming decade.</b>
