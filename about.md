title: "My life"
---
I was born in February 2003 and had a normal childhood and education. I developed an early interest in computers, setting up a fully functional Minecraft server at the age of 10 on an early-stage MacBook. I was also fascinated by my dad's work as a Solution Architect, and I found the concept of coding quite appealing. Fast forward to 2021: while watching the World Cup with friends, we dramatically crashed into a tree on our way to a football match. I was airlifted to St George's Hospital after sustaining a severe brain injury and narrowly survived a coma that lasted 3.5 weeks. Subsequently, I was moved to Epsom Hospital, where I spent six months.

Indeed, the brain injury profoundly affected my life but also instilled in me a strong determination. Consequently, between a year and a half to a year later, I enrolled at university and moved into university halls, beginning a foundation year to gradually acclimate to university life following my injury.

I excelled during my foundation year, achieving 83.90% in MATH054, thanks to discovering and being mentored by a PhD Maths student, Henry Thomas. I began my degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) in 2023. AI has been instrumental in my recovery and a life-saver, supporting me post-injury and significantly aiding in regaining my independence through summarising and personalised one-to-one teaching. I utilise AI in every possible way, from my phone to my computers, where I manually adjust the titles of my chats with checkboxes ([ ]) to systematically traverse them, thereby ensuring a comprehensive understanding and mastery of all topics discussed.

I performed well in my first year, achieving 80% in my [math test]({{ site.baseurl }}/Users/alfienurse/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-alfienurse@gmail.com/My Drive/Career/GitPage/alfie-ns.github.io/quiz.md) and {report grade} in my report for the maths module COMP1003, where I studied and implemented a complex C# AVL tree. I also achieved 71% in COMP1001, a challenging, weed-out type of module, where I learned C and C++. I am now preparing for my second year and particularly looking forward to my third-year modules, where I'll be studying Machine Learning and Human-Robot Interaction.
