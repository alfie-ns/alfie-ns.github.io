title: "My life"
---
I was born in February 2003 and experienced a normal childhood and education. I developed an early interest in computers, setting up a fully functional Minecraft server at the age of 10 on an early-stage MacBook. Additionally, I was fascinated by my dad's work as a Solution Architect and found the concept of coding quite appealing. Fast forward to 2021; I was watching the World Cup with friends, and in my friend's car, on our way to watch a football match, we dramatically crashed into a tree in an embankment. I was airlifted to St George's Hospital after sustaining a severe brain injury and narrowly survived a coma that lasted 3.5 weeks. Subsequently, I moved to Epsom Hospital and spent six months there.

Indeed, the brain injury has profoundly affected my life, but it has also instilled in me a strong determination. Consequently, I enrolled at university and moved into university halls in 2022—between a year and a half to a year later—beginning a foundation year to gradually acclimate to university life following my injury.

I excelled during my foundation year, achieving 83.90% in MATH054, thanks to discovering and being mentored by a PhD Maths student. I began my degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) in 2023. AI has been instrumental in my recovery and a life-saver, supporting me post-injury and significantly aiding in regaining my independence through summarising and personalised one-to-one teaching. I utilise AI in every possible way, from my phone to my computers, where I manually adjust the titles of my chats with checkboxes ([ ]) to systematically traverse them, thereby ensuring a comprehensive understanding and mastery of all topics discussed.

Once again, I performed well in my first year, achieving 80% in my maths test and {report grade} in my report for the maths module. I am now preparing for my second year and particularly looking forward to my third-year modules, where I'll be studying Machine Learning and Human-Robot Interaction.
