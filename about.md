title: "My life"
---
I was born in February 2003 and had a normal childhood and education. I developed an early interest in computers, setting up a fully functional Minecraft server at the age of 10 on an early-stage MacBook. I was also fascinated by my dad's work as a Solution Architect, and I found the concept of coding quite appealing. Fast forward to 2021: while watching the World Cup with friends, we dramatically crashed into a tree on our way to a football match. I was airlifted to St George's Hospital after sustaining a severe brain injury and narrowly survived a coma that lasted 3.5 weeks. Subsequently, I was moved to Epsom Hospital, where I spent six months.

Indeed, the brain injury profoundly affected my life but also instilled in me a strong determination. Consequently, between a year and a half to a year later, I enrolled at university and moved into university halls, beginning a foundation year to gradually acclimate to university life following my injury.

I excelled during my foundation year, achieving 83.90% in MATH054, thanks to discovering and being mentored by a PhD Maths student, Henry Thomas. I began my degree in <a href="https://alfie-ns.github.io/BSc_Computer_Science.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88">Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)</a>
in 2023. AI has been instrumental in my recovery and a life-saver, supporting me post-injury and significantly aiding in regaining my independence through summarising and personalised one-to-one teaching. I utilise AI in every possible way, from my phone to my computers, where I manually adjust the titles of my chats with checkboxes ([ ]) to systematically traverse them, thereby ensuring a comprehensive understanding and mastery of the chat's content.

I performed well in my first year, achieving 80% in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1003-test" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">math test</a> and {report grade} in my report for the maths module COMP1003, where I studied and implemented a complex <a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/1003-CW/blob/main/Report/AVL/Solution/dotnet-program/Program.cs" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">C# AVL tree.</a> I also achieved <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1001-cw" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">71% in the COMP1001 report</a>, a challenging, weed-out type of module, with a <a href="https://github.com/alfie-ns/1001-CW" target="_blank" style="color: #448c88;">C++ implementation</a>. I am now preparing to work relentlessly hard in year 2, while looking forward to my third-year modules, where I'll be studying Machine Learning and Human-Robot Interaction.
