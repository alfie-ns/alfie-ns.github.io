title: "My life"
---

I was born in February 2003 and experienced a normal childhood and education. I developed an early interest in computers, setting up a fully functional Minecraft server at the age of 10 on an early-stage MacBook. Additionally, I was fascinated by my dad's work as a Solution Architect and found the concept of coding quite appealing. <b>Fast forward to 2021;</b> I was watching the 2021 World Cup with friends. In my friend's car, on our way to a football match, we dramatically crashed into an embankment. I was airlifted to St George's Hospital after sustaining a <b>severe brain injury</b> and barely survived a coma that lasted 3.5 weeks. Subsequently, I moved to Epsom Hospital and spent six months there.

Of course, the brain injury has profoundly affected my life, but it has also instilled in me a strong determination. Consequently, I enrolled at university and moved into university halls in 2022—between a year and a half to a year later—since I am in no rush to start working, concerning my ongoing insurance claim. This allowed me to gradually acclimate to university life.

I excelled during my foundation year, achieving 83.90% in MATH054, thanks to discovering and being mentored by a PhD Maths student. I began my degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) in 2023. AI has been instrumental in my recovery and a life-saver, supporting me post-injury and significantly aiding in regaining my independence through personalised, one-to-one teaching. I utilise AI in every possible way, from my phone to my computer, where I manually adjust the titles of my chats with checkboxes ([ ]) to systematically traverse them, thereby ensuring a comprehensive understanding and mastery of all topics discussed.
